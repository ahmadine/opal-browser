Opal-Parser compilation example
===============================

To compile everything, run:

    $ ./build.sh

NOTE: This kind of integration, while cool, is highly unrecommended for production purposes.
You would rather want to compile your application from Ruby to JavaScript yourself (on a server
or whatnot), than let it be compiled in a web browser.
